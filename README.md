# The_Dicee_Game
This was my first JavaScript project working with DOM. 
On The Dice Game there are Player 1 dice and Player 2 dice, when the user refreshes the website these dices get thrown randomly, so that Player 1 and Player 2 both will have their own dice values and the website will then announce the winner based on whose player has the higher dice value.
